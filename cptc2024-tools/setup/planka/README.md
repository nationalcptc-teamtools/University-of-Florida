This is an open source kanban board that we use to keep track of tasks during the engagement

Make sure to change `BASE_URL` as described in the file (and the default username/password) and then run `docker-compose up`


To back up the board, simply change the names of the docker containers in `docker-backup.sh` and run it. Restore with `docker-restore.sh`
